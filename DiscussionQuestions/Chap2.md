1. What is a type parameter? 
A Type parameter is a generic parameter that can represent either a value or a reference type variable.
2. What does a type parameter do?
A type parameter makes your code very versatile by eliminating the excess steps of casting, boxing and unboxing variable types. A type parameter acts as a placeholder for any future type of variable the programmer decides to use.

 3. How many type parameters can a generic class have? 
A generic class can have innumerable type parameters

4. What is the difference between a generic class and a generalized class? 
A generic class is a class that takes type parameters and a generalized class takes object variables.
Variables of value and reference types that must be cast, boxed and unboxed as necessary. 

5. What is a constraint? How do you specify a constraint? 
A Constraint is a limitation placed on a type parameter.

6. What is a generic method? How do you define a generic method?
A generic method is a method that takes type parameters 

 7. What do we mean when we say that a generic type interface is invariant?
A generic type interface is invariant when

 8. What do we mean when we cay that a generic type interface is covariant?

 9. Does covariance work with value types? Does it work with reference types?

 10. What do we mean when we say that a generic type interface is contravariant?
