3. What is the ASP.NET Web API? 
A framework that offers the ASP.NET MVC development style but is tailored to writing HTTP services. 
4. What is routing, and how does it work in ASP.NET MVC?
ASP.NET Web API uses the same routing systems for mapping URLs to controller actions. It contextualizes the routing to HTTP services by mapping HTTP verbs to action by convention, which both makes the code easier to read and encourages following Restful service design.
 5. What is model binding? What is data validation? How do these work in ASP.NET MVC? 
API automatically maps HTTP request values to model values, Web API automatically maps HTTP
request values to model.  The binding system is extensible and includes the same attribute-based validation that you use in MVC model binding.

Display modes are a convention-based approach to allow selecting different views based on the browser making the request.
9. What are bundling and minification? How do they work in ASP.NET MVC?
Bundling and minification(as described below) collaborate to reduce requests to your sight by combing several individual scripts and references into a single request.

Bundling is rolling up specific scripts and reference them with a single URL.  
Minification is shrinking requests to your sight by using techniques such as shortening variable names and removing whitespace and comments.
